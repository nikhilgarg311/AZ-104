## What is cloud computing?
Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services on the internet.
___

## Explain shared responsibility model.
Start with a traditional corporate datacenter. The company is responsible for maintaining the physical space, ensuring security, and maintaining or replacing the servers if anything happens. The IT department is responsible for maintaining all the infrastructure and software needed to keep the datacenter up and running. They’re also likely to be responsible for keeping all systems patched and on the correct version.

With the shared responsibility model, these responsibilities get shared between the cloud provider and the consumer. Physical security, power, cooling, and network connectivity are the responsibility of the cloud provider. The consumer isn’t collocated with the datacenter, so it wouldn’t make sense for the consumer to have any of those responsibilities.

With an on-premises datacenter, you’re responsible for everything. With cloud computing, those responsibilities shift. The shared responsibility model is heavily tied into the cloud service types (covered later in this learning path): infrastructure as a service (IaaS), platform as a service (PaaS), and software as a service (SaaS). IaaS places the most responsibility on the consumer, with the cloud provider being responsible for the basics of physical security, power, and connectivity. On the other end of the spectrum, SaaS places most of the responsibility with the cloud provider. PaaS, being a middle ground between IaaS and SaaS, rests somewhere in the middle and evenly distributes responsibility between the cloud provider and the consumer.

## What are cloud models?
The cloud models define the deployment type of cloud resources. The three main cloud models are: private, public, and hybrid.

**Private cloud**
Let’s start with a private cloud. A private cloud is, in some ways, the natural evolution from a corporate datacenter. It’s a cloud (delivering IT services over the internet) that’s used by a single entity. Private cloud provides much greater control for the company and its IT department. However, it also comes with greater cost and fewer of the benefits of a public cloud deployment. Finally, a private cloud may be hosted from your on site datacenter. It may also be hosted in a dedicated datacenter offsite, potentially even by a third party that has dedicated that datacenter to your company.

**Public cloud**
A public cloud is built, controlled, and maintained by a third-party cloud provider. With a public cloud, anyone that wants to purchase cloud services can access and use resources. The general public availability is a key difference between public and private clouds.

**Hybrid cloud**
A hybrid cloud is a computing environment that uses both public and private clouds in an inter-connected environment. A hybrid cloud environment can be used to allow a private cloud to surge for increased, temporary demand by deploying public cloud resources. Hybrid cloud can be used to provide an extra layer of security. For example, users can flexibly choose which services to keep in public cloud and which to deploy to their private cloud infrastructure.
___

## Describe consumption based model.
When comparing IT infrastructure models, there are two types of expenses to consider. Capital expenditure (CapEx) and operational expenditure (OpEx).
apEx is typically a one-time, up-front expenditure to purchase or secure tangible resources. A new building, repaving the parking lot, building a datacenter, or buying a company vehicle are examples of CapEx.

In contrast, OpEx is spending money on services or products over time. Renting a convention center, leasing a company vehicle, or signing up for cloud services are all examples of OpEx.

Cloud computing falls under OpEx because cloud computing operates on a consumption-based model. With cloud computing, you don’t pay for the physical infrastructure, the electricity, the security, or anything else associated with maintaining a datacenter. Instead, you pay for the IT resources you use. If you don’t use any IT resources this month, you don’t pay for any IT resources.

This consumption-based model has many benefits, including:
-> No upfront costs.
-> No need to purchase and manage costly infrastructure that users might not use to its fullest potential.
-> The ability to pay for more resources when they're needed.
-> The ability to stop paying for resources that are no longer needed.
___

## What are regions and availability zones in azure? Explain the physical infrastructure of azure.
The physical infrastructure for Azure starts with datacenters. Conceptually, the datacenters are the same as large corporate datacenters. They’re facilities with resources arranged in racks, with dedicated power, cooling, and networking infrastructure.
As a global cloud provider, Azure has datacenters around the world. However, these individual datacenters aren’t directly accessible. Datacenters are grouped into Azure Regions or Azure Availability Zones that are designed to help you achieve resiliency and reliability for your business-critical workloads.

**Regions**
A region is a geographical area on the planet that contains at least one, but potentially multiple datacenters that are nearby and networked together with a low-latency network. Azure intelligently assigns and controls the resources within each region to ensure workloads are appropriately balanced.
When you deploy a resource in Azure, you'll often need to choose the region where you want your resource deployed.

**Availability Zones**
Availability zones are physically separate datacenters within an Azure region. Each availability zone is made up of one or more datacenters equipped with independent power, cooling, and networking. An availability zone is set up to be an isolation boundary. If one zone goes down, the other continues working. Availability zones are connected through high-speed, private fiber-optic networks.

![Azure Physical Infra](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-azure/describe-core-architectural-components-of-azure/media/availability-zones-c22f95a3-14cd8677.png "Azure Physical Infra")

**Region pairs**
Most Azure regions are paired with another region within the same geography (such as US, Europe, or Asia) at least 300 miles away. This approach allows for the replication of resources across a geography that helps reduce the likelihood of interruptions because of events such as natural disasters, civil unrest, power outages, or physical network outages that affect an entire region. For example, if a region in a pair was affected by a natural disaster, services would automatically fail over to the other region in its region pair.

**Sovereign Regions**
In addition to regular regions, Azure also has sovereign regions. Sovereign regions are instances of Azure that are isolated from the main instance of Azure. You may need to use a sovereign region for compliance or legal purposes.
Azure sovereign regions include:
US DoD Central, US Gov Virginia, US Gov Iowa and more: These regions are physical and logical network-isolated instances of Azure for U.S. government agencies and partners. These datacenters are operated by screened U.S. personnel and include additional compliance certifications.
China East, China North, and more: These regions are available through a unique partnership between Microsoft and 21Vianet, whereby Microsoft doesn't directly maintain the datacenters.

___

## Describe Azure management infrastructure. What are  management group, resource groups and subscriptions?

**Resource**
A resource is the basic building block of Azure. Anything you create, provision, deploy, etc. is a resource. Virtual Machines (VMs), virtual networks, databases, cognitive services, etc. are all considered resources within Azure.

**Resource Group**
Resource groups are simply groupings of resources. When you create a resource, you’re required to place it into a resource group. While a resource group can contain many resources, a single resource can only be in one resource group at a time. Resource groups provide a convenient way to group resources together. When you apply an action to a resource group, that action will apply to all the resources within the resource group. If you delete a resource group, all the resources will be deleted. If you grant or deny access to a resource group, you’ve granted or denied access to all the resources within the resource group.

**Subscriptions**
In Azure, subscriptions are a unit of management, billing, and scale. Similar to how resource groups are a way to logically organize resources, subscriptions allow you to logically organize your resource groups and facilitate billing.
Using Azure requires an Azure subscription. A subscription provides you with authenticated and authorized access to Azure products and services. It also allows you to provision resources. An Azure subscription links to an Azure account, which is an identity in Microsoft Entra ID or in a directory that Microsoft Entra ID trusts.
![Azure Subcriptions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-azure/describe-core-architectural-components-of-azure/media/subscriptions-d415577b-04961c4b.png "Azure Subscriptions")

**Management Group**
The final piece is the management group. Resources are gathered into resource groups, and resource groups are gathered into subscriptions. If you’re just starting in Azure that might seem like enough hierarchy to keep things organized. But imagine if you’re dealing with multiple applications, multiple development teams, in multiple geographies.
If you have many subscriptions, you might need a way to efficiently manage access, policies, and compliance for those subscriptions. Azure management groups provide a level of scope above subscriptions. You organize subscriptions into containers called management groups and apply governance conditions to the management groups. All subscriptions within a management group automatically inherit the conditions applied to the management group, the same way that resource groups inherit settings from subscriptions and resources inherit from resource groups. Management groups give you enterprise-grade management at a large scale, no matter what type of subscriptions you might have. Management groups can be nested.
Important facts about management groups:
10,000 management groups can be supported in a single directory.
A management group tree can support up to six levels of depth. This limit doesn't include the root level or the subscription level.
Each management group and subscription can support only one parent.

![Azure Management Infra](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-azure/describe-core-architectural-components-of-azure/media/management-groups-subscriptions-dfd5a108-60f31f5a.png "Azure Management Infra")

## Azure Storage Services

A storage account provides a unique namespace for your Azure Storage data that's accessible from anywhere in the world over HTTP or HTTPS. Data in this account is secure, highly available, durable, and massively scalable.
When you create your storage account, you’ll start by picking the storage account type. The type of account determines the storage services and redundancy options and has an impact on the use cases.

The Azure Storage platform includes the following data services:

- **Azure Blobs**: A massively scalable object store for text and binary data. Also includes support for big data analytics through Data Lake Storage Gen2.
- **Azure Files**: Managed file shares for cloud or on-premises deployments.
- **Azure Queues**: A messaging store for reliable messaging between application components.
- **Azure Disks**: Block-level storage volumes for Azure VMs.
- **Azure Tables**: NoSQL table option for structured, non-relational data.

Benefits of Azure Storage
Azure Storage services offer the following benefits for application developers and IT professionals:

- Durable and highly available. Redundancy ensures that your data is safe if transient hardware failures occur. You can also opt to replicate data across data centers or geographical regions for additional protection from local catastrophes or natural disasters. Data replicated in this way remains highly available if an unexpected outage occurs.
- Secure. All data written to an Azure storage account is encrypted by the service. Azure Storage provides you with fine-grained control over who has access to your data.
- Scalable. Azure Storage is designed to be massively scalable to meet the data storage and performance needs of today's applications.
- Managed. Azure handles hardware maintenance, updates, and critical issues for you.
- Accessible. Data in Azure Storage is accessible from anywhere in the world over HTTP or HTTPS. Microsoft provides client libraries for Azure Storage in a variety of languages, including .NET, Java, Node.js, Python, PHP, Ruby, Go, and others, as well as a mature REST API. Azure Storage supports scripting in Azure PowerShell or Azure CLI. And the Azure portal and Azure Storage Explorer offer easy visual solutions for working with your data.

**Azure Blobs**
- Azure Blob storage is an object storage solution for the cloud. It can store massive amounts of data, such as text or binary data. Azure Blob storage is unstructured, meaning that there are no restrictions on the kinds of data it can hold. Blob storage can manage thousands of simultaneous uploads, massive amounts of video data, constantly growing log files, and can be reached from anywhere with an internet connection.
- Blobs aren't limited to common file formats. A blob could contain gigabytes of binary data streamed from a scientific instrument, an encrypted message for another application, or data in a custom format for an app you're developing. One advantage of blob storage over disk storage is that it doesn't require developers to think about or manage disks. Data is uploaded as blobs, and Azure takes care of the physical storage needs.

Blob storage is ideal for:
- Serving images or documents directly to a browser.
- Storing files for distributed access.
- Streaming video and audio.
- Storing data for backup and restore, disaster recovery, and archiving.
- Storing data for analysis by an on-premises or Azure-hosted service.
- Accessing blob storage
- Objects in blob storage can be accessed from anywhere in the world via HTTP or HTTPS. Users or client applications can access blobs via URLs, the Azure Storage REST API, Azure PowerShell, Azure CLI, or an Azure Storage client library. The storage client libraries are available for multiple languages, including .NET, Java, Node.js, Python, PHP, and Ruby.

Blob storage tiers
Data stored in the cloud can grow at an exponential pace. To manage costs for your expanding storage needs, it's helpful to organize your data based on attributes like frequency of access and planned retention period. Data stored in the cloud can be handled differently based on how it's generated, processed, and accessed over its lifetime. Some data is actively accessed and modified throughout its lifetime. Some data is accessed frequently early in its lifetime, with access dropping drastically as the data ages. Some data remains idle in the cloud and is rarely, if ever, accessed after it's stored. To accommodate these different access needs, Azure provides several access tiers, which you can use to balance your storage costs with your access needs.

Azure Storage offers different access tiers for your blob storage, helping you store object data in the most cost-effective manner. The available access tiers include:
Hot access tier: Optimized for storing data that is accessed frequently (for example, images for your website).
Cool access tier: Optimized for data that is infrequently accessed and stored for at least 30 days (for example, invoices for your customers).
Cold access tier: Optimized for storing data that is infrequently accessed and stored for at least 90 days.
Archive access tier: Appropriate for data that is rarely accessed and stored for at least 180 days, with flexible latency requirements (for example, long-term backups).
The following considerations apply to the different access tiers:

Hot, cool, and cold access tiers can be set at the account level. The archive access tier isn't available at the account level.
Hot, cool, cold, and archive tiers can be set at the blob level, during or after upload.
Data in the cool and cold access tiers can tolerate slightly lower availability, but still requires high durability, retrieval latency, and throughput characteristics similar to hot data. For cool and cold data, a lower availability service-level agreement (SLA) and higher access costs compared to hot data are acceptable trade-offs for lower storage costs.
Archive storage stores data offline and offers the lowest storage costs, but also the highest costs to rehydrate and access data.

**Azure Files**
Azure File storage offers fully managed file shares in the cloud that are accessible via the industry standard Server Message Block (SMB) or Network File System (NFS) protocols. Azure Files file shares can be mounted concurrently by cloud or on-premises deployments. SMB Azure file shares are accessible from Windows, Linux, and macOS clients. NFS Azure Files shares are accessible from Linux or macOS clients. Additionally, SMB Azure file shares can be cached on Windows Servers with Azure File Sync for fast access near where the data is being used.

Azure Files key benefits:
Shared access: Azure file shares support the industry standard SMB and NFS protocols, meaning you can seamlessly replace your on-premises file shares with Azure file shares without worrying about application compatibility.
Fully managed: Azure file shares can be created without the need to manage hardware or an OS. This means you don't have to deal with patching the server OS with critical security upgrades or replacing faulty hard disks.
Scripting and tooling: PowerShell cmdlets and Azure CLI can be used to create, mount, and manage Azure file shares as part of the administration of Azure applications. You can create and manage Azure file shares using Azure portal and Azure Storage Explorer.
Resiliency: Azure Files has been built from the ground up to always be available. Replacing on-premises file shares with Azure Files means you don't have to wake up in the middle of the night to deal with local power outages or network issues.
Familiar programmability: Applications running in Azure can access data in the share via file system I/O APIs. Developers can therefore use their existing code and skills to migrate existing applications. In addition to System IO APIs, you can use Azure Storage Client Libraries or the Azure Storage REST API.

**Azure Queues**
Azure Queue storage is a service for storing large numbers of messages. Once stored, you can access the messages from anywhere in the world via authenticated calls using HTTP or HTTPS. A queue can contain as many messages as your storage account has room for (potentially millions). Each individual message can be up to 64 KB in size. Queues are commonly used to create a backlog of work to process asynchronously.

Queue storage can be combined with compute functions like Azure Functions to take an action when a message is received. For example, you want to perform an action after a customer uploads a form to your website. You could have the submit button on the website trigger a message to the Queue storage. Then, you could use Azure Functions to trigger an action once the message was received.

**Azure Disks**
Azure Disk storage, or Azure managed disks, are block-level storage volumes managed by Azure for use with Azure VMs. Conceptually, they’re the same as a physical disk, but they’re virtualized – offering greater resiliency and availability than a physical disk. With managed disks, all you have to do is provision the disk, and Azure will take care of the rest.

**Azure Tables**
Azure Table storage stores large amounts of structured data. Azure tables are a NoSQL datastore that accepts authenticated calls from inside and outside the Azure cloud. This enables you to use Azure tables to build your hybrid or multicloud solution and have your data always available. Azure tables are ideal for storing structured, non-relational data.

## Identify Azure data migration options
Now that you understand the different storage options within Azure, it’s important to also understand how to get your data and information into Azure. Azure supports both real-time migration of infrastructure, applications, and data using Azure Migrate as well as asynchronous migration of data using Azure Data Box.

**Azure Migrate**
Azure Migrate is a service that helps you migrate from an on-premises environment to the cloud. Azure Migrate functions as a hub to help you manage the assessment and migration of your on-premises datacenter to Azure. It provides the following:

Unified migration platform: A single portal to start, run, and track your migration to Azure.
Range of tools: A range of tools for assessment and migration. Azure Migrate tools include Azure Migrate: Discovery and assessment and Azure Migrate: Server Migration. Azure Migrate also integrates with other Azure services and tools, and with independent software vendor (ISV) offerings.
Assessment and migration: In the Azure Migrate hub, you can assess and migrate your on-premises infrastructure to Azure.
Integrated tools
In addition to working with tools from ISVs, the Azure Migrate hub also includes the following tools to help with migration:

Azure Migrate: Discovery and assessment. Discover and assess on-premises servers running on VMware, Hyper-V, and physical servers in preparation for migration to Azure.
Azure Migrate: Server Migration. Migrate VMware VMs, Hyper-V VMs, physical servers, other virtualized servers, and public cloud VMs to Azure.
Data Migration Assistant. Data Migration Assistant is a stand-alone tool to assess SQL Servers. It helps pinpoint potential problems blocking migration. It identifies unsupported features, new features that can benefit you after migration, and the right path for database migration.
Azure Database Migration Service. Migrate on-premises databases to Azure VMs running SQL Server, Azure SQL Database, or SQL Managed Instances.
Azure App Service migration assistant. Azure App Service migration assistant is a standalone tool to assess on-premises websites for migration to Azure App Service. Use Migration Assistant to migrate .NET and PHP web apps to Azure.
Azure Data Box. Use Azure Data Box products to move large amounts of offline data to Azure.

**Azure Data Box**
Azure Data Box is a physical migration service that helps transfer large amounts of data in a quick, inexpensive, and reliable way. The secure data transfer is accelerated by shipping you a proprietary Data Box storage device that has a maximum usable storage capacity of 80 terabytes. The Data Box is transported to and from your datacenter via a regional carrier. A rugged case protects and secures the Data Box from damage during transit.

You can order the Data Box device via the Azure portal to import or export data from Azure. Once the device is received, you can quickly set it up using the local web UI and connect it to your network. Once you’re finished transferring the data (either into or out of Azure), simply return the Data Box. If you’re transferring data into Azure, the data is automatically uploaded once Microsoft receives the Data Box back. The entire process is tracked end-to-end by the Data Box service in the Azure portal.

Use cases
Data Box is ideally suited to transfer data sizes larger than 40 TBs in scenarios with no to limited network connectivity. The data movement can be one-time, periodic, or an initial bulk data transfer followed by periodic transfers.

Here are the various scenarios where Data Box can be used to import data to Azure.

Onetime migration - when a large amount of on-premises data is moved to Azure.
Moving a media library from offline tapes into Azure to create an online media library.
Migrating your VM farm, SQL server, and applications to Azure.
Moving historical data to Azure for in-depth analysis and reporting using HDInsight.
Initial bulk transfer - when an initial bulk transfer is done using Data Box (seed) followed by incremental transfers over the network.
Periodic uploads - when large amount of data is generated periodically and needs to be moved to Azure.
Here are the various scenarios where Data Box can be used to export data from Azure.

Disaster recovery - when a copy of the data from Azure is restored to an on-premises network. In a typical disaster recovery scenario, a large amount of Azure data is exported to a Data Box. Microsoft then ships this Data Box, and the data is restored on your premises in a short time.
Security requirements - when you need to be able to export data out of Azure due to government or security requirements.
Migrate back to on-premises or to another cloud service provider - when you want to move all the data back to on-premises, or to another cloud service provider, export data via Data Box to migrate the workloads.
Once the data from your import order is uploaded to Azure, the disks on the device are wiped clean in accordance with NIST 800-88r1 standards. For an export order, the disks are erased once the device reaches the Azure datacenter.

## Identify Azure file movement options
In addition to large scale migration using services like Azure Migrate and Azure Data Box, Azure also has tools designed to help you move or interact with individual files or small file groups. Among those tools are AzCopy, Azure Storage Explorer, and Azure File Sync.

**AzCopy**
AzCopy is a command-line utility that you can use to copy blobs or files to or from your storage account. With AzCopy, you can upload files, download files, copy files between storage accounts, and even synchronize files. AzCopy can even be configured to work with other cloud providers to help move files back and forth between clouds.
Synchronizing blobs or files with AzCopy is one-direction synchronization. When you synchronize, you designate the source and destination, and AzCopy will copy files or blobs in that direction. It doesn't synchronize bi-directionally based on timestamps or other metadata.

**Azure Storage Explorer**
Azure Storage Explorer is a standalone app that provides a graphical interface to manage files and blobs in your Azure Storage Account. It works on Windows, macOS, and Linux operating systems and uses AzCopy on the backend to perform all of the file and blob management tasks. With Storage Explorer, you can upload to Azure, download from Azure, or move between storage accounts.

**Azure File Sync**
Azure File Sync is a tool that lets you centralize your file shares in Azure Files and keep the flexibility, performance, and compatibility of a Windows file server. It’s almost like turning your Windows file server into a miniature content delivery network. Once you install Azure File Sync on your local Windows server, it will automatically stay bi-directionally synced with your files in Azure.

With Azure File Sync, you can:

Use any protocol that's available on Windows Server to access your data locally, including SMB, NFS, and FTPS.
Have as many caches as you need across the world.
Replace a failed local server by installing Azure File Sync on a new server in the same datacenter.
Configure cloud tiering so the most frequently accessed files are replicated locally, while infrequently accessed files are kept in the cloud until requested.

## Describe Azure directory services

Microsoft Entra ID is a directory service that enables you to sign in and access both Microsoft cloud applications and cloud applications that you develop. Microsoft Entra ID can also help you maintain your on-premises Active Directory deployment.

For on-premises environments, Active Directory running on Windows Server provides an identity and access management service that's managed by your organization. Microsoft Entra ID is Microsoft's cloud-based identity and access management service. With Microsoft Entra ID, you control the identity accounts, but Microsoft ensures that the service is available globally. If you've worked with Active Directory, Microsoft Entra ID will be familiar to you.

When you secure identities on-premises with Active Directory, Microsoft doesn't monitor sign-in attempts. When you connect Active Directory with Microsoft Entra ID, Microsoft can help protect you by detecting suspicious sign-in attempts at no extra cost. For example, Microsoft Entra ID can detect sign-in attempts from unexpected locations or unknown devices.

Who uses Microsoft Entra ID?
Microsoft Entra ID is for:

IT administrators. Administrators can use Microsoft Entra ID to control access to applications and resources based on their business requirements.
App developers. Developers can use Microsoft Entra ID to provide a standards-based approach for adding functionality to applications that they build, such as adding SSO functionality to an app or enabling an app to work with a user's existing credentials.
Users. Users can manage their identities and take maintenance actions like self-service password reset.
Online service subscribers. Microsoft 365, Microsoft Office 365, Azure, and Microsoft Dynamics CRM Online subscribers are already using Microsoft Entra ID to authenticate into their account.
What does Microsoft Entra ID do?
Microsoft Entra ID provides services such as:

Authentication: This includes verifying identity to access applications and resources. It also includes providing functionality such as self-service password reset, multifactor authentication, a custom list of banned passwords, and smart lockout services.
Single sign-on: Single sign-on (SSO) enables you to remember only one username and one password to access multiple applications. A single identity is tied to a user, which simplifies the security model. As users change roles or leave an organization, access modifications are tied to that identity, which greatly reduces the effort needed to change or disable accounts.
Application management: You can manage your cloud and on-premises apps by using Microsoft Entra ID. Features like Application Proxy, SaaS apps, the My Apps portal, and single sign-on provide a better user experience.
Device management: Along with accounts for individual people, Microsoft Entra ID supports the registration of devices. Registration enables devices to be managed through tools like Microsoft Intune. It also allows for device-based Conditional Access policies to restrict access attempts to only those coming from known devices, regardless of the requesting user account.
Can I connect my on-premises AD with Microsoft Entra ID?
If you had an on-premises environment running Active Directory and a cloud deployment using Microsoft Entra ID, you would need to maintain two identity sets. However, you can connect Active Directory with Microsoft Entra ID, enabling a consistent identity experience between cloud and on-premises.

One method of connecting Microsoft Entra ID with your on-premises AD is using Microsoft Entra Connect. Microsoft Entra Connect synchronizes user identities between on-premises Active Directory and Microsoft Entra ID. Microsoft Entra Connect synchronizes changes between both identity systems, so you can use features like SSO, multifactor authentication, and self-service password reset under both systems.

What is Microsoft Entra Domain Services?
Microsoft Entra Domain Services is a service that provides managed domain services such as domain join, group policy, lightweight directory access protocol (LDAP), and Kerberos/NTLM authentication. Just like Microsoft Entra ID lets you use directory services without having to maintain the infrastructure supporting it, with Microsoft Entra Domain Services, you get the benefit of domain services without the need to deploy, manage, and patch domain controllers (DCs) in the cloud.

A Microsoft Entra Domain Services managed domain lets you run legacy applications in the cloud that can't use modern authentication methods, or where you don't want directory lookups to always go back to an on-premises AD DS environment. You can lift and shift those legacy applications from your on-premises environment into a managed domain, without needing to manage the AD DS environment in the cloud.

Microsoft Entra Domain Services integrates with your existing Microsoft Entra tenant. This integration lets users sign into services and applications connected to the managed domain using their existing credentials. You can also use existing groups and user accounts to secure access to resources. These features provide a smoother lift-and-shift of on-premises resources to Azure.

How does Microsoft Entra Domain Services work?
When you create a Microsoft Entra Domain Services managed domain, you define a unique namespace. This namespace is the domain name. Two Windows Server domain controllers are then deployed into your selected Azure region. This deployment of DCs is known as a replica set.

You don't need to manage, configure, or update these DCs. The Azure platform handles the DCs as part of the managed domain, including backups and encryption at rest using Azure Disk Encryption.

Is information synchronized?
A managed domain is configured to perform a one-way synchronization from Microsoft Entra ID to Microsoft Entra Domain Services. You can create resources directly in the managed domain, but they aren't synchronized back to Microsoft Entra ID. In a hybrid environment with an on-premises AD DS environment, Microsoft Entra Connect synchronizes identity information with Microsoft Entra ID, which is then synchronized to the managed domain.

Diagram of Microsoft Entra Connect Sync synchronizing information back to the Microsoft Entra tenant from on-premises AD.

Applications, services, and VMs in Azure that connect to the managed domain can then use common Microsoft Entra Domain Services features such as domain join, group policy, LDAP, and Kerberos/NTLM authentication.

## Describe Azure authentication methods
Authentication is the process of establishing the identity of a person, service, or device. It requires the person, service, or device to provide some type of credential to prove who they are. Authentication is like presenting ID when you’re traveling. It doesn’t confirm that you’re ticketed, it just proves that you're who you say you are. Azure supports multiple authentication methods, including standard passwords, single sign-on (SSO), multifactor authentication (MFA), and passwordless.

For the longest time, security and convenience seemed to be at odds with each other. Thankfully, new authentication solutions provide both security and convenience.

The following diagram shows the security level compared to the convenience. Notice Passwordless authentication is high security and high convenience while passwords on their own are low security but high convenience.

Four quadrant diagram showing security versus convenience, with Passwords + 2 Factor authentication being high security but low convenience.

What's single sign-on?
Single sign-on (SSO) enables a user to sign in one time and use that credential to access multiple resources and applications from different providers. For SSO to work, the different applications and providers must trust the initial authenticator.

More identities mean more passwords to remember and change. Password policies can vary among applications. As complexity requirements increase, it becomes increasingly difficult for users to remember them. The more passwords a user has to manage, the greater the risk of a credential-related security incident.

Consider the process of managing all those identities. More strain is placed on help desks as they deal with account lockouts and password reset requests. If a user leaves an organization, tracking down all those identities and ensuring they're disabled can be challenging. If an identity is overlooked, this might allow access when it should have been eliminated.

With SSO, you need to remember only one ID and one password. Access across applications is granted to a single identity that's tied to the user, which simplifies the security model. As users change roles or leave an organization, access is tied to a single identity. This change greatly reduces the effort needed to change or disable accounts. Using SSO for accounts makes it easier for users to manage their identities and for IT to manage users.

Single sign-on is only as secure as the initial authenticator because the subsequent connections are all based on the security of the initial authenticator.

What’s multifactor authentication?
Multifactor authentication is the process of prompting a user for an extra form (or factor) of identification during the sign-in process. MFA helps protect against a password compromise in situations where the password was compromised but the second factor wasn't.

Think about how you sign into websites, email, or online services. After entering your username and password, have you ever needed to enter a code that was sent to your phone? If so, you've used multifactor authentication to sign in.

Multifactor authentication provides additional security for your identities by requiring two or more elements to fully authenticate. These elements fall into three categories:

Something the user knows – this might be a challenge question.
Something the user has – this might be a code that's sent to the user's mobile phone.
Something the user is – this is typically some sort of biometric property, such as a fingerprint or face scan.
Multifactor authentication increases identity security by limiting the impact of credential exposure (for example, stolen usernames and passwords). With multifactor authentication enabled, an attacker who has a user's password would also need to have possession of their phone or their fingerprint to fully authenticate.

Compare multifactor authentication with single-factor authentication. Under single-factor authentication, an attacker would need only a username and password to authenticate. Multifactor authentication should be enabled wherever possible because it adds enormous benefits to security.

What's Microsoft Entra multifactor authentication?
Microsoft Entra multifactor authentication is a Microsoft service that provides multifactor authentication capabilities. Microsoft Entra multifactor authentication enables users to choose an additional form of authentication during sign-in, such as a phone call or mobile app notification.

What’s passwordless authentication?
Features like MFA are a great way to secure your organization, but users often get frustrated with the additional security layer on top of having to remember their passwords. People are more likely to comply when it's easy and convenient to do so. Passwordless authentication methods are more convenient because the password is removed and replaced with something you have, plus something you are, or something you know.

Passwordless authentication needs to be set up on a device before it can work. For example, your computer is something you have. Once it’s been registered or enrolled, Azure now knows that it’s associated with you. Now that the computer is known, once you provide something you know or are (such as a PIN or fingerprint), you can be authenticated without using a password.

Each organization has different needs when it comes to authentication. Microsoft global Azure and Azure Government offer the following three passwordless authentication options that integrate with Microsoft Entra ID:

Windows Hello for Business
Microsoft Authenticator app
FIDO2 security keys
Windows Hello for Business
Windows Hello for Business is ideal for information workers that have their own designated Windows PC. The biometric and PIN credentials are directly tied to the user's PC, which prevents access from anyone other than the owner. With public key infrastructure (PKI) integration and built-in support for single sign-on (SSO), Windows Hello for Business provides a convenient method for seamlessly accessing corporate resources on-premises and in the cloud.

Microsoft Authenticator App
You can also allow your employee's phone to become a passwordless authentication method. You may already be using the Microsoft Authenticator App as a convenient multifactor authentication option in addition to a password. You can also use the Authenticator App as a passwordless option.

The Authenticator App turns any iOS or Android phone into a strong, passwordless credential. Users can sign-in to any platform or browser by getting a notification to their phone, matching a number displayed on the screen to the one on their phone, and then using their biometric (touch or face) or PIN to confirm. Refer to Download and install the Microsoft Authenticator app for installation details.

FIDO2 security keys
The FIDO (Fast IDentity Online) Alliance helps to promote open authentication standards and reduce the use of passwords as a form of authentication. FIDO2 is the latest standard that incorporates the web authentication (WebAuthn) standard.

FIDO2 security keys are an unphishable standards-based passwordless authentication method that can come in any form factor. Fast Identity Online (FIDO) is an open standard for passwordless authentication. FIDO allows users and organizations to leverage the standard to sign-in to their resources without a username or password by using an external security key or a platform key built into a device.

Users can register and then select a FIDO2 security key at the sign-in interface as their main means of authentication. These FIDO2 security keys are typically USB devices, but could also use Bluetooth or NFC. With a hardware device that handles the authentication, the security of an account is increased as there's no password that could be exposed or guessed.
